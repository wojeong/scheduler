# Interview Scheduler
Scheduler is a React based application where students can pick a date and the time of interview.
They can book an interview by picking the time and date, inputing their names and the interviewer of their choice.
They can also modify existing Appointement by editing or deleting.

React handled the client-side actions while PostgreSQL was used to manage the database.
